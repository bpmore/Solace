### Requirements

The Solace Theme requires the Genesis Framework which can be purchased at http://www.studiopress.com/.

### Terms of Use

The Solace Theme does not include support.

I reserve the right to modify these terms or remove the theme entirely from GitHub at my discretion.

Thanks to @bgardner for the inspiration and the Genesis Framework.

### Theme Setup

The Solace Theme is minimalist at heart. Some functionality of the Genesis Framework has been removed.
